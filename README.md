# pass-mas-mobile

A react-native project using [Expo](https://expo.io/) to save own passwords. This app uses SQLite to store data. 
I aimed to learn to build cross platform mobile application and also I aimed to use in daily life. 

## Installation

 - Install Expo from [here](https://docs.expo.io/)
 - Clone this repository to local 
 - Use `npm install` to install modules


## Semi-Dependencies

This app can be used offline only. Besides offline, user may want to backup data and restore from another device. To restore, this app sends and synchronizes data with MongoDb using a web api. Web api project can be accessible on [this repo](https://github.com/kordiseps/pass-mas-server).
Also a web application planned.
